Graph Visualization Demo
========================
A simple graph visualization experiment written in Dart.

The program takes directed graphs in a variety of formats and draws them to the screen.
In order to compactly display nodes with minimal overlap each node is modelled as having a
spring between it and each other node where the length depends on whether the nodes are connected.
